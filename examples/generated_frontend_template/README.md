ANARI Device Template
=====================

This repository contains a template to use with the code generator
in the ANARI-SDK.

## Steps

1. Copy the contents of this directory to a location outside the ANARI SDK.
2. Rename and edit `device/template_device.json` to your needs.
3. Add a license in and/or rename `license.txt` to contain a header which will be inserted at the top of every generated
source file.
4. Edit `CMakeLists.txt` to reflect these name changes and also change the names and arguments to
`anari_generate_frontend` to your liking (everything called "template" or "tplt")
5. Initialize with `cd build && cmake ../`. this will populate the device directory with source files. The ones in
`device/generated` should not be edited manually since they will be overwritten on every regeneration. The ones in
`device/src` are meant to be edited and won't be overwritten unless they are deleted or regeneration is forced.
6. `make` builds the for now empty device. The device is "functional" in the sense that it accepts and reports all
specified parameters (according to the .json) and returns empty framebuffers.
7. Start adding functionality in `Specializations.h`, `FrameObject.h/.cpp` and `ArrayObjects.h/.cpp`

The `TARGET` argument to `anari_generate_frontend` in the `CMakeLists.txt` specifies the code generator target for
`make`.

After making changes to the json file or its dependencies the frontend can be regenerated by making the generator
target. This will overwrite all the files in `device/generated` making additional object types, parameters and strings
available.

Generated Files in `device/src` can be regenerated to their initial state individually by deleting them and making the
generator target.

Everything can be forcibly regenerated with by appending `_force` to the generator target name. This will overwrite
edits to any generated files. It will however preserve the old versions of files by appending `.old`. To integrate
improvements to the generated into edited versions forcibly regenerate them and then use a diff tool to merge changes
into the newly generated files (for example `meld foo.cpp foo.cpp.old`).
